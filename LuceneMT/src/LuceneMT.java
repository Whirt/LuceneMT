/** Lucene Models and Tolerant retrieval test on sMarT benchmark
 * 
 * Apache Lucene is high-performance java API that supports fulltext-searching,
 * which include indexing, text pre-processing, scoring, querying and several 
 * utils and unique feature (such as Query and Scoring personalization).
 * 
 * This project focus on showing briefly what does it provides for Tolerant 
 * Retrieval and Modelling, so knowledge about classic information retrieval 
 * model is assumed. It's based on Lucene 7.2.1 which doesn't differ too much
 * from previous versions.
 * 
 * Test and evaluation (Precision & Recall) will be based on SMART benchmark.
